# AZCrowdfunding

This repository contains the work of Ángeles Aldunate and Alfonso Zúñiga, who were given the task of creating a 
crowdfunding web application for the Web Technologies course dictated in the fall of 2018.What follows is a simple 
report on the progress that the team has achieved in the fourth assignment, alongside a list of possible bugs that the 
user might encounter along the way.

## Progress

For this assignment every feature that was solicited has been integrated, including the implementation of sign in with Facebook, flash notifications with different colors depending on the actions, a markdown for the project, the complete funding flow using action mailer (IMPORTANT: Allow access to non secure applications, the mail from wich the emails are being sent is : azcrowdfunding@gmail.com, pass:AZ123456!, if needed for testing ). Also a searching bar is implemented, and diferenciation from admin and regular users is made by a gem called "rails-admin".

## Possible Bugs

As the team is still learning, the user may encounter a bug or two along the way. This may include (but shouldn't after 
the intense debugging the team has made) dead links, buttons with routes wrongly specified, the site crushing when faced
with malicious input, etc.
